# AI Candidate Matcher — Session Handoff

## Project

AI Candidate Matcher

Current version: `0.1.0.dev0`

## Goal

Continue developing an AI-assisted candidate rediscovery and shortlisting application for small recruitment agencies and employers.

The organization supplies or authorizes the candidate pool. The app does not scrape arbitrary websites. It filters candidates, creates evidence-based AI assessments, requires recruiter review, and generates editable outreach drafts that are copied or exported manually.

## Current status

Sprint 0 and Sprint 1 are complete.

`FOUND-001` through `FOUND-005`, `DATA-001`, and `DATA-002` are complete. The project now has a Django
5.2.17 LTS foundation, a custom user model, organizations, memberships,
constrained administrator/recruiter roles, optional organization-owned client
companies, organization-scoped queryset and authorization helpers, login and
POST-only logout, responsive base templates, organization selection, and a
minimal organization dashboard. It also has strict environment parsing,
fail-closed production configuration, initial migrations, dependency locking,
pytest-django and Ruff configuration, import-isolation tests, one local/CI
quality command, and a Python 3.11–3.14 GitHub Actions matrix. It also has
organization-owned candidate, source/consent, and private candidate-document
models with tenant-scoped querysets, database constraints, retention/deletion
metadata, and Django admin support. Organization-owned vacancies now support an
optional same-organization client and versioned requirement snapshots with
source/schema provenance, structured requirement fields, confirmation metadata,
and immutable confirmed history. No recruiter-facing candidate or vacancy intake
UI and no document or AI extraction exists yet.

The next roadmap item is:

`DATA-003 — Add manual candidate entry and CSV import with validation and duplicate reporting.`

## Required instructions

1. Read `AGENTS.md` completely.
2. Read `docs/project_state.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/product_spec.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/toolkit_integration.md`, and `docs/toolkit_feedback.md` before changing anything.
3. Inspect the repository; do not assume files or APIs exist.
4. Implement only the next approved roadmap task.
5. Do not redesign, skip ahead, or expand scope without a concrete reason and user approval.
6. Keep the application separate from Python AI Toolkit.
7. Initially install the published `python-ai-toolkit[django]==1.0.0` package.
8. Do not copy or edit toolkit source inside this repository.
9. Record suspected toolkit improvements in `docs/toolkit_feedback.md`; treat them as unverified until reproduced.
10. Keep recruitment decisions human-controlled and exclude protected characteristics from matching.

## Current verification

Verified on 2026-08-10 with Python 3.12.13:

- Django system check passed.
- 83 pytest tests passed.
- Ruff lint and format checks passed.
- All 29 installed packages passed dependency compatibility checks.
- `python-ai-toolkit==1.0.0` imports from `.venv` site-packages.
- The application repository contains no local `ai` toolkit source package.
- The normal and warning-strict production Django checks passed.
- No migration drift was detected.

## Immediate next action

Implement only `DATA-003`: recruiter-facing manual candidate entry and CSV import
with validation and duplicate reporting, preserving organization isolation and
keeping document upload/extraction in `DATA-004`.
